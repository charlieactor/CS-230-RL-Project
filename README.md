# CS-230-RL-Project

This repo contains just the publicly shareable code from my Stanford CS230 RL project, the goal of which is to learn optimal storage strategies for items within a 3D grid according to their entry/exit sequence and location. This code will not be runnable from this repository, as it has dependencies on a proprietary repo that I cannot share.
